# Twitrender
Twitrender is a small app that leverages a big database.
 
The [database](https://github.com/mihailgaberov/twitter-bot/tree/v2) is  growing since 2017. 

The app gives the users ability to search for certain words and see how many times they have been twitted during a selected time period. Hence _trender_ => _twitrender_.

:tada: The more interesting feature of the app would be the ability to search for _most_ twitted word of phrase in certain time period.
